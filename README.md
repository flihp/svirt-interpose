svirt-interpose
===============

A stand-alone implementation of sVirt intended to be interposed between a Xen toolstack and qemu.

Building
--------
Building svirt-interpose requires the libselinux and libxenstore headers.
Once those are installed building should just be a matter of running make in the svirt-interpose root directory.
